This module project uses the mock company "Run Buddy" to teach foundational HTML, CSS, and Git. Guided building of this app featured media queries and flexbox to make the website site more engaging and mobile-responsive. The goal was to make an "attractive and intuitive user interface" using advanced CSS selectors and custom properties. One of the things I learned during this project was the importance of being careful in matching class names between the html and stylesheets, and paying close attention HTML structure. It was also my first exposure to CSS variables (which are incredibly helpful for webistes with colors that are used repetedly!) and Git branch/merge workflow.

CSS Variables Used:

```
:root {
  --primary-color: #fce138;
  --secondary-color: #024e76;
  --tertiary-color: #39a6b2;
}
```

CSS Media Queries Used:

```
@media screen and (max-width: 980px) {}
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {}
@media screen and (max-width: 575px) {}
```
